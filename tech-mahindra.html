                  tech mahindra fundamental and technical analysis for value investing
                 
                  tech mahindra share analysis
                  Tech mahindra share analysis the fifth biggest IT company in india

                  and a market cap of

                  almost 97,000 crore (12 january 2021) therefore it

                  is in a race to become

                  the top IT

                  companies in world just like TCS is now the

                  biggest IT company in the world

                  so the reason of us doing tech mahindra share analysis is

                  tech mahindra financials
                  tech mahindra as on 15-02-2021 has almost a market cap of

                  almost 97,000 crore

                  and in fy 2020 it’s revenue was

                  39,000 (almost) and it is a large cap in india

                  and a part of nifty- the index.so why investing tech mahindra?.

                  first in the covid 19 crash one of the best permofing even in the

                  lockdown has been the IT

                  tech mahindra financials
                  tech mahindra
                  data credit goes to ticker tape
                  so the conclusion from the stat’s is that the revenue

                  of tech mahindra

                  is simply growing over the years and

                  the company has also provided good dividend over the years

                  and has always provided better return than fixed

                  deposit every year and also it is large cap company

                  and run by congomolerate mahindra

                  group and the great industrialist Anand Mahindra as CEO.

                  balance sheet
                  tech mahindra
                  however one of the reason behind

                  tech mahindra share analysis is

                  because it has a very strong balance

                  sheet that its

                  total asset is much greater than

                  it’s liabilities which is a

                  indication that even in hard times for instance

                  such as

                  covid-19 lockdown there is almost

                  no chance of company bankruptcy

                  because even that has happened in

                  big companies just like

                  Kodak bankruptcy

                  tech mahindra ratios
                  tech mahindra
                  tech mahindra
                  tech mahindra
                  tech mahindra
                  all the data credit goes to moneycontrol
                  Over the last 5 years, revenue has grown at a yearly rate of 10.86%, vs industry avg of 9.75%.

                  Over the last 5 years, market share increased from 7.13% to 7.55%.

                  in the last 5 years, net income has grown at a yearly rate of 8.95%, vs industry avg of 8.05%.

                  above all the point of investing in tech mahindra

                  is that it’s high profitability margin PBDIT MARGIN of almost 20 that has remained

                  almost constant however is has been decreased slowly over years (not a big issue)

                  but the biggest strength of tech mahindra and of all good companies is

                  that it’s consistent net increasing profit over the years

                  net income
                  in right year is 2020
                  so this is a indication along with it’s increasing revenue and market cap

                  total revenue
                  is indicstion that it is one of the best company in

                  graph
                  graph credit goes to investing.com

                  but when in 2008 global share market

                  crashed the share price almost gone to 100

                  but now in 2020 the share price has gone almost to 1000

                  in a period of 10 years

                  so tech mahindra over a period of 10 years has given

                  almost 10 times return and understand that is excluding

                  consistent dividend company has given to it’s share holders.
