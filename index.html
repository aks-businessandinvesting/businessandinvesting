            <h2>yes bank share analysis</h2>
            <p>thinking of a stock which will give you high return and also a high market capitalisation (A big company already)

            so according to our analysis and research if you want a company in banking sector which can give

            manifold return and also a big market capitalisation (both not frequently found together properties) and

            you are also a somewhat risky investor with high risk appetite so yes bank can

            give you high return but as on now (8-02-2021) it is of not considered to

            buy but now it is advised to just keep a close eye on stock as stock now in sideways zone .

            but now bank has stabilised after SBI taking its control and its CEO became Prashant Kumar ,

            former Chief financial officer of SBI. and also LIC has bought a major stake in company as well

            has increased much stake in company which gives indication that big institutions and funds also now has

            and yet has exposure in yes bank even LIC.

            history and origin
            Yes Bank Limited is an Indian private sector bank headquartered in Mumbai, India[7] and was founded by Rana Kapoor and Ashok Kapur in 2004.

            yes bank 2020 crisis
            at one time yes bank has amazed people by becoming the fastest growing private sector bank of its time and

            also the high amount of interests that it pay to its investors but on 5 march 2020 the reserve bank of india after

            considering the benefits of its share holders and its depositers after considering the high amount of bad loans and net NPA .

            Yes bank FPO
            yes bank on announced its FPO to raise almost 15,000 rupee from the markets to adjust their ratios which are highly specified

            and mandatory by a bank for its proper functioning and any functional crisis prevention so the money

            which would come from FPO would adjust the ratios and thus stability the bank.

            Financial statements analysis
            in FY 2020 yes bank has reported a net loss of over 16,000 the year in which reserve bank of india has announced it’s takeover by

            SBI along with many other big banks has come in that period and had bought stake in YES Bank at a mere price of approx 10 rupees range .


            yes bank charts

            Yes bank share analysis final conclusion
            after the analysis our final outlook is that it is just wait and watch share as stock is in range bound .

            so our advice to all investors is that do no investment in yes bank and wait till its fundamentals

            improve which indication will come as soon as the stock will go above 20 and the definite indication

            of company share uptrend and company financial health improvement will come</p>

            <h2>ashok leyland share analysis</h1>
            <p>ashok leyland share fundamental and technical analysis for value investing
            
            The share of ashok leyland has been rallied almost 20% in two days much after budget announcement

            but you are thinking of investing in ashok leyland our goal of writing this is you can get every information

            and view of big brokers such as morgan stanley before investing in ashok leyland

            forst for start from the beginning ashok leyland only manufactures commercial vehciles and some

            gensets also but in india it is always in top two in heavy and medium vehcile manufacturing and among three after

            mahindra&mahindra when light weight vehcile combined.

            but yoy will be thinking why ashok leyland there are around 5000 companies

            listed on Bombay stock exchange but after the market crash in march 2020 the stock of ashok

            leyland had almost touched 30 rupees level and today on 3-02-2020 the stock has nearly quadrupled

            and according to some big brokers such as morgan stanley there is also minimum 50% upside in the stock level also from this level .

            when it come to fundamental analysis after the Unionbudget2021 on 1st feb the scrrapage policy will nearly come in 15 days .

            in which commercial vehcile older than 15 years have to removed from indian roads which would ultimately create demand for

            new trucks buses and also other commercial vehciles which will definitely increase ashok leyland sales as they are

            market leader in india in truck and buses. also after union budget 2021 the goverment has clearly put

            focus on infrastucture,health infrastructure, development of ports,power plants,corridors which ultimately needs

            heavy logistics and heavy vehciles thus affecting ashok leyland share.</p>
