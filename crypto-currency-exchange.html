                <p>ashok leyland share fundamental and technical analysis for value investing
                
                The share of ashok leyland has been rallied almost 20% in two days much after budget announcement

                but you are thinking of investing in ashok leyland our goal of writing this is you can get every information

                and view of big brokers such as morgan stanley before investing in ashok leyland

                forst for start from the beginning ashok leyland only manufactures commercial vehciles and some

                gensets also but in india it is always in top two in heavy and medium vehcile manufacturing and among three after

                mahindra&mahindra when light weight vehcile combined.

                but yoy will be thinking why ashok leyland there are around 5000 companies

                listed on Bombay stock exchange but after the market crash in march 2020 the stock of ashok

                leyland had almost touched 30 rupees level and today on 3-02-2020 the stock has nearly quadrupled

                and according to some big brokers such as morgan stanley there is also minimum 50% upside in the stock level also from this level .

                when it come to fundamental analysis after the Unionbudget2021 on 1st feb the scrrapage policy will nearly come in 15 days .

                in which commercial vehcile older than 15 years have to removed from indian roads which would ultimately create demand for

                new trucks buses and also other commercial vehciles which will definitely increase ashok leyland sales as they are

                market leader in india in truck and buses. also after union budget 2021 the goverment has clearly put

                focus on infrastucture,health infrastructure, development of ports,power plants,corridors which ultimately needs

                heavy logistics and heavy vehciles thus affecting ashok leyland share.

                According to the latest interview given by ashok leyland the commercial vehcile sector is bottoming out.
