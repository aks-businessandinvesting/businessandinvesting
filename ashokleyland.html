                <h2>ashok leyland share analysis</h2>
                <p>ashok leyland share fundamental and technical analysis for value investing
                
                The share of ashok leyland has been rallied almost 20% in two days much after budget announcement

                but you are thinking of investing in .ashok leyland our goal of writing this is you can get every information

                and view of big brokers such as morgan stanley before investing in ashok leyland

                forst for start from the beginning ashok leyland only manufactures commercial vehciles and some

                gensets also but in india it is .always in top two in heavy and medium vehcile manufacturing and among three after

                mahindra&mahindra when light weight vehcile combined.

                but yoy will be thinking why ashok leyland there are around 5000 companies

                listed on Bombay stock exchange. but after the market crash in march 2020 the stock of ashok

                leyland had almost touched 30 rupees level and today on 3-02-2020 the stock has nearly quadrupled

                and according to some big brokers such. as morgan stanley there is also minimum 50% upside in the stock level also from this level .

                when it come to fundamental analysis after the Unionbudget2021 on 1st feb the scrrapage policy will nearly come in 15 days .

                in which commercial vehcile older than .15 years have to removed from indian roads which would ultimately create demand for

                new trucks buses and also other commercial vehciles which will definitely increase ashok leyland sales as they are

                market leader in india in truck and buses. also after union budget 2021 the government has clearly put

                focus on infrastucture,health infrastructure, development of ports,power plants,corridors which ultimately needs

                heavy logistics and heavy vehciles .thus affecting ashok leyland share.

                According to the latest interview given by ashok leyland the commercial vehcile sector is bottoming out.

                Sales.
                Hinduja group flagship firm Ashok Leyland reported an 11 per cent increase in total vehicle sales at 13,126 units in January 2021.

                The company had sold 11,850 units in the corresponding month a year ago. Total domestic vehicle sales stood at 12,359 units in January

                against 10,850 units in the year-ago .period, registering an increase of 14 per cent.

                Medium and heavy commercial vehicles (M&HCV) sales in the domestic market were down 2 per cent at 6,839 units last month as

                compared with 6,949 units in the year-ago month.

                Light commercial vehicle sales .in the domestic last month stood at 5,520 units as compared with 3,901 units in January 2020, up 42 per cent.

                <p> basically the greatest amount of wealth in equity market is made when a bear market is over and a bull market starts 
                    just like in commercial vehcile segment the CV industry
                    and the whole auto industry. is bottoming out after 
                    a very long down cycle.
                    as we know that any fleet owner makes money when 70% of its 
                    fleet strength or capacity is being utilised and according
                    to data the fleet owner have .achieved this criteria 
                    in today,s covid world so there .is a huge demand of 
                    commercial vehcile that we will see in coming time
                    and ashok leyland will definitely benefit from it.</p>
                <h3>promoters impact</h3>
                <p>the one of the biggest factor in the development of 
                    any company is the role of promoters and that's the 
                    point we are saying that ashok .leyland is owned by the 
                    congomolerate hinduja group (they are the richest in UK).
                    so whenever promoters of a company. a big and reliable
                    there is less chance of company bankruptcy and shareholders
                    risk's get minimized so .in case of ashok leyland promoters
                    role you can relax as they are among the best.</p>
                <h3>future positions</h3>
                <p>as we all know that india will definitely develop
                    in economy due to many factors. and .for any company's development 
                    major factors are development of ports, airports,schools, highways,
                    and many other infrastructure. related activities.</p>

         <h2>power of compounding</h2>
         <p>power of compound interest
          power of compound interest saving your money and want to become rich but do you know 
           saving your money in savings account and fixed deposit you are thinking your money i
           s growing but a harsh reality is that your money is not growing and you are just beat
           flation which is most time in range of 5-10% same and most of time greater than your
            saving account interest and almost equal or similar to your fixed deposit rates. Read 
            ull article to see power of compound interest. thus actually your money is not
             appreciating and it is depreciating most time by putting in savings or fixed deposit 
             or in traditional ways giving return 5-10% or return less than even inflation. power
              of compounding power of compounding on money or investment simply means interest on
               the interest plus the principal amount that you have invested. lets you understand 
               by a example suppose you have 100$ to invest and in the first year you are expecting
                annum or in the first year and in the second year the base or principal of investment
                 is 115$ and then 15% interest will be calculated on that 115$ which is now the 
                 principal amount and at the end of second year the principal amount will be 132.25$ 
                 and the process continues. it will seem small when seen on a small amount and 
                 also mainly when seen for a short span of time. but when seen on a large span 
                 of time the compounding can just show magic or power. suppose in india at the age 
                 of 25 you have 10,00,000rupees and you have to retire at age of 55 so you will have 
                 almost 100,10,00,000 rupees almost 14 million dollar which will put you in world 
                 richest 1% if in compounding you are doubling your money every three years.
                  power of compound interest suppose you have 10,00,000 money of any currency in 
                  first year and you are able to double your money every three year 28 th birthday)</p>

                       <p>and for this magic to happen you have to compound your money at approximately
                        22-26% range which is just some bigger than average return of index of stock
                         markets of most countries and wait this in is index return the stock return 
                         of a company can be manifold so just start using power of compounding from
